		<p>Here is definition about homestay in <cite>Wikipedia</cite>:</p>
		<blockquote cite="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homestay">
		Homestay is a form of tourism and/or study abroad that allows a visitor to rent a room from a local family in a homelike setting. It is sometimes used for improving language skills and getting familiar with the local lifestyle.[1] Homestays can occur anywhere in the world, but certain countries encourage homestay as a means of developing their tourism industry.[2] Hosting a homestay participant also allows the local family to earn income. Students tend to arrange a homestay with their school or educational institution, but they can also informally arrange to stay with a family through social connections as well as through a variety of private agencies. There are a number of online homestay agencies that connect students with hosts families all over the world, usually for a nominal fee.[3]

		<h4>Types of homestay</h4>
		<hr>
		<p>
		Homestay opportunities range from a complete family experience to a single-room rental.<br>		
		The goal of a homestay is for the student to be entirely immersed in their host culture, as they live, eat and share the majority of their time with their host family. In addition to typical daily activities, family events can involve activities such as dining out, going to amusement parks, camping, traveling and so on. The host student may be expected to pay a portion of the activity-related costs, e.g., tickets, parking, gas and travel expenses.

		The student may also be invited to participate in holiday festivities, or family events like weddings and birthdays. Host families can play a pseudo-parental role, giving advice and sometimes supervising students' activities. In many homestays, families also act as cross-cultural advisers, helping the students understand and adjust to their new culture.[4] In other homestays, students may simply be renting a room within a private home with minimal supervision from the host. There are also working homestay agreements where a student is expected to perform duties such as yard work, farm work, babysitting, or maid services. These vary on a case-by-case basis.

		<h4>Typical contracts and agreements</h4>
		<hr>
		<p>
		To minimize difficulties, most homestay arrangements involve a contract or written agreement between the host and the student. Verbal agreements may change contractual clauses depending upon developments after a stay has begun. A contract typically outlines what is expected of the host student and may include items such as:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Chores to perform (e.g., cleaning, laundering)</li>
			<li>Curfews</li>
			<li>Use of the Internet,television, and/or telephone</li>
			<li>Smoking/drinking/drugs rule</li>
